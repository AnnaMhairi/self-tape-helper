RACHEL: Hey, how's it going?
ROSS: Not so good. I just found out my monkey's been seeing another human.
RACHEL: Marcel? Are you serious?
ROSS: Yeah, I mean, he's been going to this other person's apartment, eating their food, sleeping in their bed.
RACHEL: Ross, that's terrible. I'm so sorry.
ROSS: I just don't understand why he'd do this to me. We were so close.
